# Culture-Enriched Mycobiome Protocol for Amphibian Feces

## Written by Javier Tabima, Tested by Aris Papadimitrou and Sam Matthews

## Purpose: 

To selectively enrich viable fungi from amphibian feces prior to DNA extraction and ITS barcoding.

## Overview

This protocol enriches fungal taxa from frog feces using a short-term liquid incubation to increase fungal biomass and reduce bacterial load before DNA extraction. The resulting DNA can be used for ITS-based community profiling or culture isolation.

## Materials

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh or frozen frog fecal pellets | Collect sterilely, store at −80 °C or in DNA/RNA Shield |
| Sterile PBS or 0.1% Tween-80 | For sample homogenization |
| Enrichment Medium | PDA- or SDA-based liquid medium |
| Antibiotics | Chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL), Streptomycin (100 µg/mL), Penicillin G (100 U/mL) |
| Sterile 50 mL tubes or flasks | For enrichment culture |
| Orbital shaker (80-100 rpm) | Gentle aeration for oxygenation |
| Centrifuge (≥5,000 × g) | To pellet cells/mycelia |
| DNA extraction kit | ZymoBIOMICS or Qiagen PowerSoil Pro |

## Enrichment Medium (Generalist)

Per 1 L of medium:

| Component                     | Amount                                                                        | Purpose             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| PDA broth powder (commercial) | 24 g                                                                          | Nutrient base       |
| Distilled water               | 1 L                                                                           | Solvent             |
| pH                            | 6.0 – 6.5                                                                     | Adjust if necessary |
| Optional: antibiotics         | Chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL), Streptomycin (100 µg/mL), Penicillin G (100 U/mL) |                     |

Autoclave the base medium, cool below 50 °C, and aseptically add antibiotics from sterile stock solutions.

## Inoculation

1\. Homogenize 1 fecal pellet in 1 mL sterile PBS or 0.1% Tween-80.  
2\. Transfer 1 mL of suspension into 9 mL enrichment medium (1:10 ratio).  
3\. Include a no-sample control tube.

## Incubation

| Parameter | Setting | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Temperature | 25-28 °C | Optimal for gut fungi |
| Agitation | 80-100 rpm | Gentle shaking |
| Duration | 48-72 h | Check daily for growth |

- Cloudy medium or small hyphal fragments → fungal growth. 
- Strong odor or heavy turbidity → bacterial contamination.

## Harvesting the Enrichment

1\. Centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 10 min.  
2\. Discard supernatant and wash pellet once in sterile PBS.  
3\. Proceed to DNA extraction or plate aliquots for culture isolation.

##  DNA Extraction

Extract DNA using a stool/soil DNA kit with bead-beating. Include blanks and medium-only controls. Quantify DNA with Qubit or Nanodrop.

## ITS Barcoding / Amplicon Sequencing

| Step | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Target region | ITS2 (preferred) - Novogene|
| Analysis | QIIME2 + DADA2 + UNITE database |

## Optional Modifications

| Goal | Modification |
| --- | --- |
| Broader diversity | Run SDA and YM broths in parallel |
| Zygomycete enrichment | Add 0.1 % casein hydrolysate; incubate microaerobically |
| Slow growers | Dilute medium 1:2 with water; incubate 5 days |
| Mixed-kingdom profiling | Extract DNA for both ITS2 and 16S rRNA amplicons |

## 10\. Expected Outcomes

• Increased fungal biomass for DNA extraction  
• Recovery of diverse gut- and environment-associated fungi (e.g., Basidiobolus, Mucor, Candida, Aspergillus)  
• Option to isolate viable cultures for downstream identification
