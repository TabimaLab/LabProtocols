We strive for scientific excellence meaning we are clear, thorough and methodical with our science, of course. However, the most important thing in the lab is you and your mental and emotional health. This means that, while I expect you to be an integral and complete scientist, I also immensely value you as a human being. Failures and all. In addition, as a community I expect a largely collaborative research group. While each project may have and independent leader, we strive in our differences and our knowledge. Ask for help, share your results and your concerns, don’t be afraid of failing but be ready to learn from your mistakes, and celebrate and use your community of the lab (and the department) as your academic (and personal, if you so wish) support structure. Finally, as a general note, I expect all members in the lab to do the following: Foster and nurture your scientific motivation! I understand that working with animal poop is probably not the way you thought you life is going to be. However, think about the beautiful things we can find there! All the diversity and ecological interactions that reflect so many facets of life… Read and try to stay up to date with the scientific literature. There are a list of papers that are mandatory to read as part of being in the lab (Google docs folder I shared with you when you join the lab). In addition, start creating a mendeley/EndNote/Zotero list of papers of interest that you read (or at least skim in depth) and can use for your publications and presentations Learn the basic protocols for your research project. We have a folder with protocols in the Google Drive folder that includes the basic elements all members of the lab should know, so please study them before attempting to replicate them. ASK FOR HELP!! Either me or the more senior students already have experience with these methods, so ask us to guide you through them Maintain a complete, well annotated and super detailed laboratory notebook. Make sure to be very very detailed: What protocol did you use? Did you modify it in any way possible? What were the results? Take pictures of all the gels, tables, ect, and add them to the notebook. Be very strict with this: Your notebook is the support of all of your results, the guide to troubleshooting and the holy grail of what is working and not. This is your most sacred document and treat it as such! Attend Lab meetings. We will get together every Thursday at noon. Bring lunch or I can get pizza for everyone. This is the space where we will be a community and discuss our results, troubleshoot our protocols, and read relevant literature. Some terms we will do result presentations, some terms we will learn how to program and bioinformatics, some terms we will talk about papers. Lab meetings are mandatory!! Send me the papers/posters/important documents that will be shared widely. Since we are working in a collaborative manner, I need to provide my input (even if minimally) to any of the papers, posters, presentations that will be presented in public. This way we maintain uniformity and I can also be held responsible for the elements presented. We are a team!

Keep suspended pellet @ 4℃ for 24-48hrs to allow pellet to dissolve. When measuring concentration/purity, use wide-bore tips to avoid shearing.  Extraction Notes [#]  Additional tissue can be stored in a sterile 2mL tube @ -20℃. Vortexing HMW DNA causes it to break resulting in smaller fragment lengths. Always mix by inversion or on a rotator/shaker. Always transfer solution containing DNA using wide-bore tips. Normal pipette tips are narrow and will shear high-molecular weight DNA. An alternative to wide-bore tips is to cut the ends off pipette tips with sterile scissors to they have a larger opening. Take care to only transfer from the aqueous phase. To ensure contaminants are not transferred, consider leaving a small volume of the aqueous layer behind. Over drying pellet is not recommended as DNA can convert from B to D form making later resuspension difficult. Post-Extraction Steps  Perform Qubit fluorometric quantification to obtain DNA concentration.  Measure DNA concentration and contamination using NanoDrop spectroscopy.  7.2 Bead-cleaning protocols Add a a 1 to 1 volume of MagBeads to the extracted and eluted DNA Mix by flickering the tube gently and put the tube in the hula mixer for five minutes Place the tube in a magnetic rack.

Discard any PPE that contacts either mixture. Necessary PPE includes:  Safety glasses  Lab coat  Nitrile gloves  Neoprene gloves over nitrile gloves  If you are exposed to Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol OR Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol please follow the management protocol below.  Inhalation: Secure and move away from source to an area with fresh, ventilated air. Monitor symptoms and contact medical services if needed. Most inhalation exposure can be quickly managed and lab members can return to work shortly.  Skin or eye exposure: Remove PPE and clothes from exposed area. Wash with warm water and soap for 15 minutes using a sink or eyewash (if eyes were exposed). After washing, file an incident report with lab leadership and seek medical attention.  Liquid Nitrogen is a dangerous chemical that can cause burns and damage organic tissue. It should only be handled while wearing full PPE including:  Safety glasses Lab coat Nitrile gloves Cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves If you are exposed to Liquid Nitrogen, please follow the management exposure below.  Skin or eye exposure: Soak the affected areas in warm water for 15 minutes. Do not agitate affected areas via rubbing. After soaking, file an incident report with lab leadership and seek medical attention.  7.6 Reagent Function and Troubleshooting  Buffer Mixes  Buffer A - 0.35 M sorbitol; 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9; 5 mM EDTA, pH 8  Buffer B - 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 9; 50 mM EDTA, pH 8; 2 M NaCl; 2% CTAB  Buffer C - 5% Sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt SIGMA L5125)  Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)  Removes phenolic compounds from DNA. Polyphenols bind to DNA and co-precipitate with nucleic acid reducing purity. PVP removes polyphenol contamination by binding via hydrogen bonds and accumulates in the interphase when centrifuged with chloroform [1].  Proteinase K  Digestion of contaminant proteins from a nucleic acid solution is performed by addition of proteinase K.  Potassium Acetate  C2H3O2K precipitates nucleic acids into the solution’s supernatant.   Phenol  As an organic solvent, phenol removes proteins and polysaccharide contamination in conjunction with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol. Additionally, DNA is insoluble in phenol because DNA is polar, and phenol is nonpolar [1].  Chloroform  Nonpolar proteins and lipids are dissolved in chloroform which, together with cellular debris, form the organic layer. This process leaves DNA isolated in the aqueous phase [1].  Isoamyl Alcohol  C5H12O serves many roles in stabilizing the organic, interphase, and aqueous layers. It prevents chloroform from foaming when in contact with air. Foaming causes emulsification of the solution resulting in difficulties when purifying DNA. It additionally stabilizes the interphase layer as it is not miscible in the aqueous or organic layers. Finally, it helps to inhibit RNase activity and reduce RNA molecule contamination [1].  Sodium Acetate  C2H3NaO2 neutralizes the charged sugar phosphate backbone of DNA. This process only occurs in the presence of isopropanol [1].  Isopropanol  To precipitate nucleic acids from the supernatant, an alcohol must be used to break the hydration shell that forms around nucleic acid. Isopropanol is a preferred choice as it has a high capacity to reduce the dielectric constant of water and therefore less (0.6-0.7x volume supernatant) can be used in comparison to ethanol (2-3x volume supernatant). A low dielectric constant is needed in conjunction with sodium acetate to precipitate nucleic acid [1].  Ethanol  Washes with 70% EtOH remove excess salt from the extraction buffer which may remain in the DNA pellet [1]. Ice cold ethanol should be used for washes.  TE Buffer  To store DNA for an extended period, TE buffer is used in place of sterile water. The buffer contains Tris, which buffers the solution by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, and EDTA, which protects DNA from DNases or RNases by chelating magnesium ions necessary for their function. Dilution of TE buffer with sterile water when sending samples for sequencing is recommended [1].  Background  What is high molecular weight (HMW) DNA?  DNA considered HMW consists of strands greater than 50 kb in length [2].  Why is HMW DNA useful for assembling eukaryotic genomes?  The genomes of higher eukaryotes often contain many repeated regions greater than several kilobases in length. First and second-generation sequencing technologies rely on DNA reads between 50bp and 1kb which produces fragmented genome assemblies that cannot accurately map repeated regions. HMW DNA using fragments in the 10s of kilobases long which improves the accuracy of eukaryotic genome assembly as longer reads can span repeated regions. Longer reads also contribute to better alignment of DNA contigs within the scope of the entire genome [2].  Why are both Qubit and NanoDrop spectroscopy used to quantify DNA concentration?  Qubit quantification detects dyes that only bind to dsDNA molecules. This allows for highly accurate quantification of dsDNA concentration even in the presence of contaminants or ssDNA/RNA. Additionally, Qubit dyes have trouble binding to small nucleic acid fragments and plasmid DNA meaning only longer length fragments are measured [4].  NanoDrop assesses DNA concentration by measuring UV absorbance at 230nm, 260nm and 280nm wavelengths. NanoDrop cannot differentiate between nucleic acid and contaminants that absorb at the same wavelength which can contribute to inaccurate concentration readings. NanoDrop measurement also does not account for fragment length and measures all DNA equally. Yet, nucleic acid purity ratios including proteins and phenols (260/280) and organic contaminants (260/230) can only be determined by NanoDrop [3].  7.7 References  [1] Heikrujam, J., Kishor, R., &amp; Behari Mazumder, P.

Expected Outcomes", " Chapter 12 Culture-Enriched Mycobiome Protocol for Amphibian Feces 12.1 Written by Javier Tabima, Tested by Aris Papadimitrou and Sam Matthews 12.2 Purpose: To selectively enrich viable fungi from amphibian feces prior to DNA extraction and ITS barcoding. 12.3 Overview This protocol enriches fungal taxa from frog feces using a short-term liquid incubation to increase fungal biomass and reduce bacterial load before DNA extraction. The resulting DNA can be used for ITS-based community profiling or culture isolation. 12.4 Materials Item Notes Fresh or frozen frog fecal pellets Collect sterilely, store at −80 °C or in DNA/RNA Shield Sterile PBS or 0.1% Tween-80 For sample homogenization Enrichment Medium PDA- or SDA-based liquid medium Antibiotics Chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL), Streptomycin (100 µg/mL), Penicillin G (100 U/mL) Sterile 50 mL tubes or flasks For enrichment culture Orbital shaker (80-100 rpm) Gentle aeration for oxygenation Centrifuge (≥5,000 × g) To pellet cells/mycelia DNA extraction kit ZymoBIOMICS or Qiagen PowerSoil Pro 12.5 Enrichment Medium (Generalist) Per 1 L of medium: Component Amount Purpose PDA broth powder (commercial) 24 g Nutrient base Distilled water 1 L Solvent pH 6.0 – 6.5 Adjust if necessary Optional: antibiotics Chloramphenicol (50 µg/mL), Streptomycin (100 µg/mL), Penicillin G (100 U/mL) Autoclave the base medium, cool below 50 °C, and aseptically add antibiotics from sterile stock solutions. 12.6 Inoculation 1. Homogenize 1 fecal pellet in 1 mL sterile PBS or 0.1% Tween-80. 2. Transfer 1 mL of suspension into 9 mL enrichment medium (1:10 ratio). 3. Include a no-sample control tube. 12.7 Incubation Parameter Setting Notes Temperature 25-28 °C Optimal for gut fungi Agitation 80-100 rpm Gentle shaking Duration 48-72 h Check daily for growth Cloudy medium or small hyphal fragments → fungal growth. Strong odor or heavy turbidity → bacterial contamination. 12.8 Harvesting the Enrichment 1. Centrifuge at 5,000 × g for 10 min. 2. Discard supernatant and wash pellet once in sterile PBS. 3. Proceed to DNA extraction or plate aliquots for culture isolation. 12.9 DNA Extraction Extract DNA using a stool/soil DNA kit with bead-beating. Include blanks and medium-only controls. Quantify DNA with Qubit or Nanodrop. 12.10 ITS Barcoding / Amplicon Sequencing Step Details Target region ITS2 (preferred) - Novogene Analysis QIIME2 + DADA2 + UNITE database 12.11 Optional Modifications Goal Modification Broader diversity Run SDA and YM broths in parallel Zygomycete enrichment Add 0.1 % casein hydrolysate; incubate microaerobically Slow growers Dilute medium 1:2 with water; incubate 5 days Mixed-kingdom profiling Extract DNA for both ITS2 and 16S rRNA amplicons 12.12 10. Expected Outcomes • Increased fungal biomass for DNA extraction • Recovery of diverse gut- and environment-associated fungi (e.g., Basidiobolus, Mucor, Candida, Aspergillus) • Option to isolate viable cultures for downstream identification "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
