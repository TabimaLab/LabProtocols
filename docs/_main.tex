\chapter{Goals and Expectations}\label{goals-and-expectations}}

The goal of this research group is to study our topics of interest in a passionate yet humane way. We strive for scientific excellence meaning we are clear, thorough and methodical with our science, of course. However, the most important thing in the lab is you and your mental and emotional health. This means that, while I expect you to be an integral and complete scientist, I also immensely value you as a human being. Failures and all.

In addition, as a community I expect a largely collaborative research group. While each project may have and independent leader, we strive in our differences and our knowledge. Ask for help, share your results and your concerns, don't be afraid of failing but be ready to learn from your mistakes, and celebrate and use your community of the lab (and the department) as your academic (and personal, if you so wish) support structure.

Finally, as a general note, I expect all members in the lab to do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Foster and nurture your scientific motivation! I understand that working with animal poop is probably not the way you thought you life is going to be. However, think about the beautiful things we can find there! All the diversity and ecological interactions that reflect so many facets of life\ldots{}
\item
  Read and try to stay up to date with the scientific literature. There are a list of papers that are mandatory to read as part of being in the lab (Google docs folder I shared with you when you join the lab). In addition, start creating a mendeley/EndNote/Zotero list of papers of interest that you read (or at least skim in depth) and can use for your publications and presentations
\item
  Learn the basic protocols for your research project. We have a folder with protocols in the Google Drive folder that includes the basic elements all members of the lab should know, so please study them before attempting to replicate them. ASK FOR HELP!! Either me or the more senior students already have experience with these methods, so ask us to guide you through them
\item
  Maintain a complete, well annotated and super detailed laboratory notebook. Make sure to be very very detailed: What protocol did you use? Did you modify it in any way possible? What were the results? Take pictures of all the gels, tables, ect, and add them to the notebook. Be very strict with this: Your notebook is the support of all of your results, the guide to troubleshooting and the holy grail of what is working and not. This is your most sacred document and treat it as such!
\item
  Attend Lab meetings. We will get together every Thursday at noon. Bring lunch or I can get pizza for everyone. This is the space where we will be a community and discuss our results, troubleshoot our protocols, and read relevant literature. Some terms we will do result presentations, some terms we will learn how to program and bioinformatics, some terms we will talk about papers. Lab meetings are mandatory!!
\item
  Send me the papers/posters/important documents that will be shared widely. Since we are working in a collaborative manner, I need to provide my input (even if minimally) to any of the papers, posters, presentations that will be presented in public. This way we maintain uniformity and I can also be held responsible for the elements presented. We are a team!

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Spin the PowerBead Pro Tube briefly to ensure that the beads have settled at the bottom. Add up to 250 mg of soil and 800 Âµl of Solution CD1. Vortex briefly to mix.

  Note: PowerBead Pro Tube contains a buffer that will help disperse the soil particles, begin to dissolve humic acids, and protect nucleic acids from degradation.
\item
  \emph{Homogenize samples thoroughly} - Secure the PowerBead Pro Tube horizontally on a Vortex Adapter for 1.5--2 ml tubes. Vortex at maximum speed for 10 min.

  Note: If using the Vortex Adapter for more than 12 preps simultaneously, increase the vortexing time by 5--10 min.
\item
  Centrifuge the PowerBead Pro Tube at 15,000 x g for 1 min.
\item
  Transfer the supernatant to a clean 2 ml Microcentrifuge Tube.

  Note: Expect 500--600 Âµl. The supernatant may still contain some soil particles.
\item
  Add 200 Âµl of Solution CD2 and vortex for 5 s.

  Note: Solution CD2 contains IRT, which will remove contaminating organic and inorganic matter that may reduce DNA purity.
\item
  Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Avoiding the pellet, transfer up to 700 Âµl of supernatant to a clean 2 ml Microcentrifuge Tube.

  Note: Expect 500--600 Âµl.
\item
  Add 600 Âµl of Solution CD3 and vortex for 5 s.

  Note: Solution CD3 will adjust the DNA solution salt concentration to allow binding of DNA to the MB Spin Column filter membrane.
\item
  Load 650 Âµl of the lysate onto an MB Spin Column and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min.

  Note: DNA is selectively bound to the silica membrane in the MB Spin Column.
\item
  Discard the flow-through and repeat step 8 to ensure that all of the lysate has passed through the MB Spin Column.
\item
  Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a clean 2 ml Collection Tube. Avoid splashing any flow-through onto the MB Spin Column.
\item
  Add 500 Âµl of Solution EA to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min.

  Note: Solution EA is a wash buffer and is removing protein and other non-aqueous contaminants.
\item
  Discard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column back into the same 2 ml Collection Tube.
\item
  Add 500 Âµl of Solution C5 to the MB Spin Column. Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min.

  Note: Solution C5 is an ethanol-based wash solution to further clean the DNA.
\item
  Discard the flow-through and place the MB Spin Column into a new 2 ml Collection Tube.
\item
  Centrifuge at up to 16,000 x g for 2 min. Carefully place the MB Spin Column into a new 1.5 ml Elution Tube.

  Note: This spin removes residual Solution C5, which is critical.
\item
  Add 50--100 Âµl of Solution C6 to the center of the white filter membrane.

  Note: Releases DNA from the silica membrane.
\item
  Centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 1 min. Discard the MB Spin Column. The DNA is now ready for downstream applications.

  Note: Store the DNA frozen (--30 to --15Â°C or --90 to --65Â°C) as Solution C6 does not contain EDTA.

\item
  Centrifuge @ 6000 x g for 10 minutes.
\item
  Transfer aqueous supernatant using wide-bore pipette tips to new 2ml lo-bind tubes {[}3, 4{]}.
\item
  Add 1ml Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol to tubes containing supernatant, hula mixer for 5 minutes, incubate at room temp for 2 minutes.
\item
  Centrifuge @ 6000 x g for 10 minutes.
\item
  Pipette supernatant using wide-bore tips into new 2ml lo-bind tubes.
\item
  Add 2.5ÂµL RNase A to each tube and leave in 37â incubator for 30min.
\item
  Estimate tubes volume and add 1/10x volume Sodium Acetate, 1x volume cold isopropyl alcohol.
\item
  Mix gently by inversion, incubate @ room temp for 5 minutes.
\item
  Centrifuge @ 3000 x g for 2 minutes, gently remove and discard supernatant. A white pellet should remain at the bottom of tubes.
\item
  Wash pellet w/ 1mL, fresh, cold, 70\% Ethanol.
\item

\item
  Keep suspended pellet @ 4â for 24-48hrs to allow pellet to dissolve. When measuring concentration/purity, use wide-bore tips to avoid shearing.~
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Extraction Notes {[}\#{]}}~

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Additional tissue can be stored in a sterile 2mL tube @ -20â.
\item
  Vortexing HMW DNA causes it to break resulting in smaller fragment lengths. Always mix by inversion or on a rotator/shaker.
\item
  Always transfer solution containing DNA using wide-bore tips. Normal pipette tips are narrow and will shear high-molecular weight DNA. An alternative to wide-bore tips is to cut the ends off pipette tips with sterile scissors to they have a larger opening.
\item
  Take care to only transfer from the aqueous phase. To ensure contaminants are not transferred, consider leaving a small volume of the aqueous layer behind.
\item
  Over drying pellet is not recommended as DNA can convert from B to D form making later resuspension difficult.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Post-Extraction Steps}~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Perform Qubit fluorometric quantification to obtain DNA concentration.~
\item
  Measure DNA concentration and contamination using NanoDrop spectroscopy.~

\textbf{Buffer Mixes}~

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Buffer A - 0.35 M sorbitol; 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9; 5 mM EDTA, pH 8~
\item
  Buffer B - 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 9; 50 mM EDTA, pH 8; 2 M NaCl; 2\% CTAB~
\item
  Buffer C - 5\% Sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt SIGMA L5125)~
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)}~

Removes phenolic compounds from DNA. Polyphenols bind to DNA and co-precipitate with nucleic acid reducing purity. PVP removes polyphenol contamination by binding via hydrogen bonds and accumulates in the interphase when centrifuged with chloroform {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Proteinase K}~

Digestion of contaminant proteins from a nucleic acid solution is performed by addition of proteinase K.~

\textbf{Potassium Acetate}~

C2H3O2K precipitates nucleic acids into the solution's supernatant.~~

\textbf{Phenol}~

As an organic solvent, phenol removes proteins and polysaccharide contamination in conjunction with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol. Additionally, DNA is insoluble in phenol because DNA is polar, and phenol is nonpolar {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Chloroform}~

Nonpolar proteins and lipids are dissolved in chloroform which, together with cellular debris, form the organic layer. This process leaves DNA isolated in the aqueous phase {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Isoamyl Alcohol}~

C5H12O serves many roles in stabilizing the organic, interphase, and aqueous layers. It prevents chloroform from foaming when in contact with air. Foaming causes emulsification of the solution resulting in difficulties when purifying DNA. It additionally stabilizes the interphase layer as it is not miscible in the aqueous or organic layers. Finally, it helps to inhibit RNase activity and reduce RNA molecule contamination {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Sodium Acetate}~

C2H3NaO2 neutralizes the charged sugar phosphate backbone of DNA. This process only occurs in the presence of isopropanol {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Isopropanol}~

To precipitate nucleic acids from the supernatant, an alcohol must be used to break the hydration shell that forms around nucleic acid. Isopropanol is a preferred choice as it has a high capacity to reduce the dielectric constant of water and therefore less (0.6-0.7x volume supernatant) can be used in comparison to ethanol (2-3x volume supernatant). A low dielectric constant is needed in conjunction with sodium acetate to precipitate nucleic acid {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Ethanol}~

Washes with 70\% EtOH remove excess salt from the extraction buffer which may remain in the DNA pellet {[}1{]}. Ice cold ethanol should be used for washes.~

\textbf{TE Buffer}~

To store DNA for an extended period, TE buffer is used in place of sterile water. The buffer contains Tris, which buffers the solution by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, and EDTA, which protects DNA from DNases or RNases by chelating magnesium ions necessary for their function. Dilution of TE buffer with sterile water when sending samples for sequencing is recommended {[}1{]}.~

\textbf{Background}~

\textbf{What is high molecular weight (HMW) DNA?}~

DNA considered HMW consists of strands greater than 50 kb in length {[}2{]}.~

\textbf{Why is HMW DNA useful for assembling eukaryotic genomes?}~

The genomes of higher eukaryotes often contain many repeated regions greater than several kilobases in length. First and second-generation sequencing technologies rely on DNA reads between 50bp and 1kb which produces fragmented genome assemblies that cannot accurately map repeated regions. HMW DNA using fragments in the 10s of kilobases long which improves the accuracy of eukaryotic genome assembly as longer reads can span repeated regions. Longer reads also contribute to better alignment of DNA contigs within the scope of the entire genome {[}2{]}.~

\textbf{Why are both Qubit and NanoDrop spectroscopy used to quantify DNA concentration?}~

Qubit quantification detects dyes that only bind to dsDNA molecules. This allows for highly accurate quantification of dsDNA concentration even in the presence of contaminants or ssDNA/RNA. Additionally, Qubit dyes have trouble binding to small nucleic acid fragments and plasmid DNA meaning only longer length fragments are measured {[}4{]}.~

NanoDrop assesses DNA concentration by measuring UV absorbance at 230nm, 260nm and 280nm wavelengths. NanoDrop cannot differentiate between nucleic acid and contaminants that absorb at the same wavelength which can contribute to inaccurate concentration readings. NanoDrop measurement also does not account for fragment length and measures all DNA equally. Yet, nucleic acid purity ratios including proteins and phenols (260/280) and organic contaminants (260/230) can only be determined by NanoDrop {[}3{]}.~
