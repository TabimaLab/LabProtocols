Question 1: What commands you used to download the files?
```
wget link 
```

Question 2: What kind of sequence (DNA/RNA/Protein) is the S79522.seq file? Briefly justify your answer.

DNA sequences because we can see all 4 nucleic acids A,C,T,G 

Question 3: What kind of of sequence (DNA/RNA/Protein) is the AAB21188.seq file? Briefly justify your answer.

Protein because we can see the different amino acids that make protein sequences 

Question 4: How many lines are found on this file?

```
wc S79522.seq
```
1 line 

Question 5: How many characters are found on this file? (Or, what is the length of this sequence?)

541 

Question 6: How many A, C, G, and T can you find in this sequence?

**how can i do this without the pipeline** 

**why does this total 540 when it says bytes are 541** 

 grep -o G S79522.seq | wc -l
131
grep -o A S79522.seq | wc -l
171
grep -o T S79522.seq | wc -l
134
grep -o C S79522.seq | wc -l
104

Question 7: Convert this sequence to RNA and save it in a file called S79522_RNA.seq. Please add the command you used to create the file. (Don’t create a complementary strand, just convert this one from DNA to RNA)

```
sed s/T/U/g S79522.seq > S79522_RNA.seq
```


Question 8: How can we test that this new file is an RNA sequence S79522_RNA.seq. Please add a command you’d use to check if this is DNA or RNA.

`head S79522_RNA.seq`  shows me if the T's are actually replaced with U's. 

Question 9: Finally, using your RNA sequence, check how many start codons (AUG) or stop codons (UAG,UAG, or UGA) may exist in your sequence

**change one stop codon to UAA** 

```
grep -o AUG S79522_RNA.seq
  11
grep -o UAG S79522_RNA.seq 
  3
grep -o UAA S79522_RNA.seq 
  10 
grep -o UGA S79522_RNA.seq
  14
```

Question 10: How many characters are found on this file? (Or, what is the length of this sequence?)

**change the file name to AAB21188.seq** 

```
wc AAB21188.seq
```
157 

Question 11: Select two aminoacids of interest and count them. Please add the command used to count them.

```
grep -o M AAB21188.seq
  2
grep -o C AAB21188.seq 
  6
```

Question 12: Which patterns do you find in the sequence? Fill in this table:

**change the file name in the table to AAB21188.seq** 

|   Sequence   | Ribosomal 27 | Ubiquitin | IBR | DNA poly A |
|:------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:---:|:----------:|
| AAB21188.seq | yes          | yes       | no  | no         |

Question 12: Did these results match what you did at the beginning of the lab? Expand briefly your answer.

**change to question 13** 

**change in the example of `grep -c` to `grep -o`**

yes, this is the same number as from before, it is the same outcome just in one line of code. 

Question 13: How would you count the other nucleotides?. Add the code below:

**change to question 14**

```
nucC=$(grep -o C S79522.seq | wc -l)
nucG=$(grep -o G S79522.seq | wc -l)
```

Question 14: Write a set of instructions to count ten of the aminoacids in the AAB21188.seq file.

**change to question 15** 

```
aminoM=$(grep -o M AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoM

aminoQ=$(grep -o Q AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoQ

aminoI=$(grep -o I AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoI

aminoF=$(grep -o F AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoF

aminoV=$(grep -o V AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoV

aminoK=$(grep -o K AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoK

aminoT=$(grep -o T AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoT

aminoL=$(grep -o L AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoL

aminoG=$(grep -o G AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoG

aminoP=$(grep -o P AAB21188.seq  | wc -l) 
echo $aminoP
```

Question 15: 

**change to question 16**


Cyberduck server

Question 15: How did you check if the files were correctly uploaded?

go to directory where they were placed and head the files 

Question 16: Briefly summarize what is a FASTA and what is a GenBank file (one sentence each)

FASTA files contain a header and the sequence while genbank files contain a lot more information about the sequence and its source 

Question 17: Can these formats include RNA, DNA and Aminoacid data? (Yes/No answer)

Yes for both 

Question 18: 
What format is the sequence_1 file in? (FASTA or GenBank) Briefly explain your answer.
FASTA
What format is the sequence_2 file in? (FASTA or GenBank) Briefly explain your answer.
GenBank 

Question 19: 
How many lines does the sequence_1 file has?
10 lines 
How can you count the number of SEQUENCES that exist in the sequence_1 file?

`grep -o '>' sequence_1 | wc -l ` 

What is the number of sequences in the sequence_1 file? Is this result different than the number of lines in the file? Why?

5 sequences, yes this is different than the amount of lines 

This extracts line 1 and 2 with all lines that do not have ">" 
```
sed -n '1,2 p' sequence_1 | grep -v ">" 
```

Extract the sequence in lines 1 and 2, that do not contain ">" and count the length 
```
sed -n '1,2 p' sequence_1 | grep -v ">" | wc -c 
```

7478

How can you save the new sequence in a new FASTA file?

use the carrot 

```
sed -n '3,4 p' sequence_1 > sequence_1_2
sed -n '5,6 p' sequence_1 > sequence_1_3
sed -n '7,8 p' sequence_1 > sequence_1_4
sed -n '9,10 p' sequence_1 > sequence_1_5
```
Question 20: 
1. Count the number of A,G,C and T?
`grep -o A sequence_1_1 | grep -v ">" | wc -l` 
  - just replace A for C,T,G 
  - replace sequence 1_1 for 1_2, 1_3, 1_4, 1_5 
2. Count the length of each sequence?
`grep -v ">" sequence_1_1 | wc -c`
  - replace sequence 1_1 for 1_2, 1_3, 1_4, 1_5
3. Count the number of open reading frames (ORF)?
`grep -o ATG sequence_1_1 | grep -v ">"  | wc -l`
  - replace sequence 1_1 for 1_2, 1_3, 1_4, 1_5

Question 21: How many lines does the sequence_2 file has?
310 lines 

Question 22: 
1. If you were looking for the information on the gene that codes for lacZ, what line would you use?
  - line 130
2. What species is this gene taken from?
  - E.coli 
3. What genomic region does this represent?
  - lactose operon
