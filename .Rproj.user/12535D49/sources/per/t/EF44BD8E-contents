18
```

Question 15: How many times does the word Potter appear? Is it the same number as in question 6?
No it is not the same because potter was mentioned in the orginal file so there are now more potters in the modified compared to the number of time Dursley is mentioned. 

Question 16: Count the number of lines of the potter.txt file and compare them to the original file. Answer question 13

Question 17: Is the number of lines similar between potter.txt and modified_file.txt? Very very briefly justify your answer.
 
Yes they are exactly the same because the only thing being modified is words, not the lines.

```
grep Potter potter.txt > potter_lines.txt
```

Question 19: What are the number of lines that say Potter in the file? Is the number different from questions 14 and 15? Explain your answer very briefly.

No it was not different, this means the mentions of potter that were in the original file must be in the same lines as the other mentions that got modified.

```
rm potter_lines.txt

Simply renames the file 

Question 23: Explain the syntax of the previous command briefly.

It is a link to the actual file instead of making a copy

Relative?
