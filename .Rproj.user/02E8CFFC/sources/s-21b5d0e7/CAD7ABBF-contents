# Lab 6 
Jasper Carleton, Devon Rose Leaver, Elizabeth Zinno


1. LG+I+G4
2. They are all the same
- Akaike:mtMAM+I+G
- Corrected Akaike:mtMAM+I+G
- Bayesian:mtMAM+I+G
3. ``` grep 'Log-likelihood of the tree'  protein_mafft.iqtree > extracted_likelihood.txt```, the value is -19733.1505 (s.e. 367.9978)
4. Most nodes have a bootstrap value above 90, with a few exceptions as listed below
- The node between gi|42565226|ref|NP_566804.3| and the ancestor of gi|85093179|ref|XP_959643.1| and gi|389640915|ref|XP_003718090.1| has a bootstrap value of 45, making it not reliable
- The node between gi|50310365|ref|XP_455202.1| and gi|50310365|ref|XP_455202.1| has a bootstrap value of 78, making it not quite reliable. 
- The node between gi|512843729|ref|XP_002935427.2| and the ancestor of gi|77736115|ref|NP_001029756.1| (and others) has a bootstrap value of 71, therefore we should be careful in using it as a data point.
- The node between gi|4557761|ref|NP_000242.1| and gi|73969550|ref|XP_538482.2| has a bootstrap value of 84, making it reasonable but not a completely reliable point.
- The node between the previous group as listed above and the group of gi|6678938|ref|NP_032654.1| and gi|13591999|ref|NP_112320.1| has a bootstrap value of  75 and therefore not a very reliable point, but not terrible. 

5. ``` mafft --globalpair --maxiterate 1000 homologenemRNA.txt > mRNA_alignment ```
6. Because G-INS-I is used for single short domains (and the other commands didn't let me use them)

|       mRNA file       | Best nucleotide model |   Likelihood score of tree  |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Your mRNA file        | TIM3+F+I+G4           | -46885.9043 (s.e. 530.5062) |
| Professorâ€™s mRNA file | TIM3+F+R3             | -49890.4729 (s.e. 564.7578) |

7. Overall there seems to be more confidence given the higher bootstrap values in my file. Additionally, the file homologene_nucl.fasta has an outlier while mine does not. 
8. Mus musculus is not aligned with all of the other sequences present in the MSA

9. A lot of the tree did stay the same, with some differences listed below
- gi|42565225|ref|NM_113607.3| Arabidopsis thaliana DNA mismatch repair protein Msh2 mRNA, complete cds change locations and relationships. The node in my file leading to this sequence has a bootstrap value of 100 while the node leading to this sequence in the professor's file has a bootstrap value of 81
- Otherwise the only change is the bootstrap values, which seem to be slightly higher on my mRNA alignment than the professor correction file.
The main difference is the movement of gi|42565225|ref|NM_113607.3| Arabidopsis thaliana DNA mismatch repair protein Msh2 mRNA, complete cds. The professor alignment has this placed diverging from a completely different branch than the aligment I made. Both trees from the alignments do have the same branch length for this sequence. Neither has this sequence having a sister 'species', but my alignment does have this sequence more nested and related to other sequences than the professor file does.
