Strategy to improve S166 sequence:

- remove adapter contamination- drop overrepresented sequences

- use LEADING and TRAILING to remove low quality parts of the beginning and end of fragents (removal of pieces under a phred score of 30)

- use SLIDING WINDOW to remove relatively lower quality areas - window of 5 and phred of 30

- use MINLEN to remove smaller sequences - aka those under 145bp

- use AVGQUAL to drop any remaining sequences under a phred score of 30


Commands to use:

- ILLUMINACLIP

- LEADING and TRAILING

- SLIDINGWINDOW

- MINLEN

- AVGQUAL

Conclusion:

This process did improve the S166 reads to a reasonable degree, mainly cutting small fragments and removing adapter contamination. Per base quality remained good and was improved to almost all having a phred of 34. All of the tile quality problems were cleaned up. My method also cleared all areas that had a phred score of less than 39
