## convert DWH.clones to rel abundance
## Divide each row by the total number of clones for that sample (row)
## The total number of clones is easily determined using the function
## rowSums
rowSums(DWH.clones)
DWH.relabund<-DWH.clones/rowSums(DWH.clones)

## Make a simple bar plot of the data
## set the color scheme, but the order is reversed in the plot
bar.col<-c("#010101","#D3E4BD","#FDD3B7","#C0E6EE","#009B9A","#9A8C4F","#FAF398","#F5EB00","#AE4A25","#E27EB3","#FACFE2","#C3489A","#A7DDE7","#00A651","#0071BB","#00AFED","#0B6196","#F7946A","#F26728","#EE2E2F")

## plot by number of clones
barplot(t(as.matrix(DWH.clones)),col=bar.col,ylab="Number of clones",las=2)
## plot by relative abundance
barplot(t(as.matrix(DWH.relabund)),las=2,ylab="Relative abundance",col=bar.col)

## Plot the rarefaction curve for all the samples
rarecurve(DWH.clones)

## Turn off the label feature to see the curves better
rarecurve(DWH.clones,label=FALSE,col=as.character(DWH.info$Sample.type.col))
## Add a legend with sample type/date
legend('bottomright',c("Plume.May","Plume.June","Plume.Sept","Surface.May","NonPlume.May","NonPlume.Sept")
       ,text.col = c("blue","green","black","red","orange","pink"),cex=0.8,bg=NA,box.col=NA)

## Answer the following questions in your HW submission
## Use the rarefaction curves generated above to assess how 
## well the community has been sampled.
## Are you satisfied with the number of clones sequenced in the 
## paper to sample the diversity of the community, or would you 
## recommend sequencing more clones and if so how many more?
## Looking at the rarefaction curves, are there any obvious patterns 
## in how well the different sample sites (i.e. plume vs non-plume vs surface
## or across certain dates) have been sampled for diversity?
## (8 pts)


## Easily determine the richness in each sampling using specnumber()
specnumber(DWH.clones)
## Put together in a table with sample the sample info
DWH.info.2<-cbind(DWH.info,specnumber(DWH.clones))
DWH.info.2

### Make a box plot of the richness by sample type
## Note: NP = Nonplume, P = Plume, S = Surface
## followed by the month of sampling

boxplot(specnumber(DWH.clones) ~ Plume.date, data = DWH.info,ylab="Species number",lab.cex=0.5,xlab=NA)


## This provides a more quantitative way to examine richness across samples
## If needed, expand the Plot box to see all of the x-axis labels
## Note that I didn't incorporate all of the data from all of the samples from Fig. 1.
## Particularly for the Plume (May) and Plume (Sept), I didn't incorporate all the samples
## here.
