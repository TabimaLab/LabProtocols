# High Molecular Weight DNA Extraction

Details of DNA extraction kit (supplier, stock #, etc.)

##Extraction Protocol
Prep: Ensure hot plate is on @ 65℃, get liquid nitrogen, get ice

1. For 2 samples - put 650µL Buffer A, 650µL Buffer B, 260µL Buffer C, 175µL PVP(1%), and 10µL Proteinase K into a 2mL tube, mix, split equally into two 2mL tubes
2. Place tubes into 65℃ hot plate
3. Pour liquid nitrogen into mortar over the pestle. Add fungi sample using a clean spatula, grind into a fine powder, add more nitrogen as needed. When finely powdered, add ~100mg of tissue into each tube
4. Incubate tubes in the new shaker for ~30 minutes (at least) @ 65℃ 
5. Add 280µL 5M Potassium Acetate to each tube, mix by inversion, incubate on ice for 5 minutes
6. Add 500-700µL Phenol Chloroform (as much as the tube can hold without overfilling), hula mixer for 5 minutes, incubate at room temp for 2 minutes
7. Centrifuge @ 6000 x g for 10 minutes
8. Transfer supernatant to new 2mL tubes, add equal volume Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol (usually ~1000µL)
Make sure you don’t grab anything from the interphase, all from the aqueous phase:

9. Mix by hula mixer for 5 minutes, incubate @ room temp for 2 minutes
10. Centrifuge @ 6000 x g for 10 minutes
11. Add supernatant to new 2mL tubes, add 2.5µL RNAse A, put in Shire for 30 minutes
12. Add 1/10x volume Sodium Acetate, 1x volume Isopropanol
13. Mix gently by inversion, incubate @ room temp for 5 minutes
14. Centrifuge @ 3000 x g for 2 minutes, pour or pipette out supernatant
15. Wash w/ 1mL, fresh, cold, 70% Ethanol
16. Centrifuge @ 3000 x g for 2 minutes, pipette out Ethanol
17. Repeat 15 and 16 one more time
18. Dry pellet @ 65℃ in hot plate for 2 minutes, resuspend in 50-100µL TE (water also works)
