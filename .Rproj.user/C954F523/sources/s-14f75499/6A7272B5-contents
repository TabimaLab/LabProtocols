# High Molecular Weight DNA Extraction

## Remaining Questions

1.  When to use cut pipet tips?

2.  g or RPM?

3.  How to troubleshoot tissue mass.

4.  Potassium acetate function.

## Required PPE

-   Safety glasses

-   Nitrile gloves

-   Cryo-gloves

-   Lab coat (8-14)

-   Fume hood (6, 8, 11)

## Pre-extraction steps

-   Set hot plate to 65℃.

-   Fill liquid nitrogen (LN2) tank.

-   Fill a bucket with ice.

## Extraction Protocol

1.  Combine 650µL Buffer A, 650µL Buffer B, 260µL Buffer C, 175µL PVP
    (1%), and 10µL Proteinase K in a 2mL tube. Mix by inversion (4) and
    split volume equally between two 2mL tubes.
2.  Place tubes in the 65℃ hot plate for 5 minutes or until warm.
3.  Using a refrigerated mortar and pestle, fill the mortar with LN2 and
    submerge the pestle until cold. Using a clean spatula, add fungal
    tissue and grind tissue into a fine powder. Add more LN2 as needed.
    Add powdered tissue to tubes from step 1.
4.  Incubate tubes in the incubator shaker (3) for \~30 minutes (at
    least) \@ 65℃.
5.  Add 280µL 5M potassium acetate to each tube. Mix tubes by inversion
    and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
6.  Add phenol chloroform until tubes are full (roughly 500 to 700µL).
    Mix the tubes in the hula mixer for 5 minutes and incubate tubes at
    room temperature for 2 minutes.
7.  Centrifuge tubes at 6000 x g for 10 minutes.
8.  Pipet aqueous phase into new 2mL tubes and discard interphase and
    organic layers. Premix chloroform and isoamyl alcohol in equal
    volumes. Add 1mL chloroform/isoamyl alcohol to tubes containing
    aqueous phase (1).

9.  Mix in the hula mixer for 5 minutes and incubate tubes at room
    temperature for 2 minutes.
10. Centrifuge tubes at 6000 x g for 10 minutes.
11. Pipet supernatant to new 2mL tubes. Add 2.5µL RNase A and put tubes
    in 37℃ incubator (shire) for 30 minutes.
12. Estimate the tube's volume. Add 1/10x volume sodium acetate and 1x
    volume isopropanol at -20℃.
13. Mix tubes gently by inversion and incubate at room temperature for 5
    minutes.
14. Centrifuge tubes at 3000 x g for 2 minutes. Pipette out as much
    supernatant as possible without disturbing pellet. Start with 1mL
    tips and use 200µL tips for residual solution.
15. Wash pellet by adding 1mL of fresh 70% Ethanol at -20℃.
16. Centrifuge tubes at 3000 x g for 2 minutes and pipette out all
    ethanol.
17. Repeat steps 15 and 16 an additional time for a total of 2 washes.
18. Loosen tube caps and dry pellet at 65℃ in the hot plate for 2
    minutes (2).
19. Resuspend pellet in 100µL TE buffer or sterile, deionized water.

**Extraction Notes**

(1) Vortexing HMW DNA causes it to break resulting in smaller fragment
    lengths. Always mix by inversion or on a rotator/shaker.

(2) Thermo Scientific thermal mixer with block (13687713).

(3) Take care to only transfer from the aqueous phase. To ensure
    contaminants are not transferred, consider leaving a small volume of
    the aqueous layer behind.

(4) Over drying pellet is not recommended as DNA can convert from B to D
    form making later resuspension difficult.

## Post-Extraction Steps

-   Perform Qubit fluorometric quantification to obtain DNA
    concentration.

-   Measure DNA concentration and contamination using NanoDrop
    spectroscopy.

## Reagent Function and Troubleshooting

**Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)**

Removes phenolic compounds from DNA. Polyphenols bind to DNA and
co-precipitate with nucleic acid reducing purity. PVP removes polyphenol
contamination by binding via hydrogen bonds and accumulates in the
interphase when centrifuged with chloroform [1].

**Proteinase K**

Digestion of contaminant proteins from a nucleic acid solution is
performed by addition of proteinase K.

**Potassium Acetate**

C2H3O2K unsure of function.

**Phenol**

As an organic solvent, phenol removes proteins and polysaccharide
contamination in conjunction with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol.
Additionally, DNA is insoluble in phenol because DNA is polar, and
phenol is nonpolar [1].

**Chloroform**

Nonpolar proteins and lipids are dissolved in chloroform which, together
with cellular debris, form the organic layer. This process leaves DNA
isolated in the aqueous phase [1].

**Isoamyl Alcohol**

C5H12O serves many roles in stabilizing the organic, interphase, and
aqueous layers. It prevents chloroform from foaming when in contact with
air. Foaming causes emulsification of the solution resulting in
difficulties when purifying DNA. It additionally stabilizes the
interphase layer as it is not miscible in the aqueous or organic layers.
Finally, it helps to inhibit RNase activity and reduce RNA molecule
contamination [1].

**Sodium Acetate**

C2H3NaO2 neutralizes the charged sugar phosphate backbone of DNA. This
process only occurs in the presence of isopropanol [1].

**Isopropanol**

To precipitate nucleic acids from the supernatant, an alcohol must be
used to break the hydration shell that forms around nucleic acid.
Isopropanol is a preferred choice as it has a high capacity to reduce
the dielectric constant of water and therefore less (0.6-0.7x volume
supernatant) can be used in comparison to ethanol (2-3x volume
supernatant). A low dielectric constant is needed in conjunction with
sodium acetate to precipitate nucleic acid [1].

**Ethanol**

Washes with 70% EtOH remove excess salt from the extraction buffer which
may remain in the DNA pellet [1]. Ice cold ethanol should be used for
washes.

**TE Buffer**

To store DNA for an extended period, TE buffer is used in place of
sterile water. The buffer contains Tris, which buffers the solution by
scavenging hydroxyl radicals, and EDTA, which protects DNA from DNases
or RNases by chelating magnesium ions necessary for their function.
Dilution of TE buffer with sterile water when sending samples for
sequencing is recommended [1].

## Background

**What is high molecular weight (HMW) DNA?**

DNA considered HMW consists of strands greater than 50 kb in length [2].

**Why is HMW DNA useful for assembling eukaryotic genomes?**

The genomes of higher eukaryotes often contain many repeated regions
greater than several kilobases in length. First and second-generation
sequencing technologies rely on DNA reads between 50bp and 1kb which
produces fragmented genome assemblies that cannot accurately map
repeated regions. HMW DNA using fragments in the 10s of kilobases long
which improves the accuracy of eukaryotic genome assembly as longer
reads can span repeated regions. Longer reads also contribute to better
alignment of DNA contigs within the scope of the entire genome [2].

**Why are both Qubit and NanoDrop spectroscopy used to quantify DNA
concentration?**

Qubit quantification detects dyes that only bind to dsDNA molecules.
This allows for highly accurate quantification of dsDNA concentration
even in the presence of contaminants or ssDNA/RNA. Additionally, Qubit
dyes have trouble binding to small nucleic acid fragments and plasmid
DNA meaning only longer length fragments are measured [4].

NanoDrop assesses DNA concentration by measuring UV absorbance at 230nm,
260nm and 280nm wavelengths. NanoDrop cannot differentiate between
nucleic acid and contaminants that absorb at the same wavelength which
can contribute to inaccurate concentration readings. NanoDrop
measurement also does not account for fragment length and measures all
DNA equally. Yet, nucleic acid purity ratios including proteins and
phenols (260/280) and organic contaminants (260/230) can only be
determined by NanoDrop [3].
