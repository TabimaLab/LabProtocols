Liam Cleary

Ph.D. Student

Liam is the Tabima Lab's first Ph.D. student and as of fall 2022 is still deciding on the direction of disertation research. His current efforts are focused on extracting high molecular weight DNA from *Basidiobolus* isolates for genome sequencing.

Liam completed his B.S. in Plant and Soil Sciences at UMass Amherst where he studied how bees interact with magnolia flowers. After graduating, he worked as a lab technician at the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University. His research focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial pathogenesis of tomato plants.
