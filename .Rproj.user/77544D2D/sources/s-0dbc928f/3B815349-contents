# How many lines are in each FASTA file?
##13904 Syn_WH101.aa.fasta 34441 Syn_WH101.cds.fasta 37578 Syn_WH101.asmb.fasta
##wc outputs number of lines, word count, and character count
```{bash}
wc Syn_WH101.aa.fasta
wc Syn_WH101.cds.fasta
wc Syn_WH101.asmb.fasta

```

# How many sequences are in each FASTA file?
## There are 2705 in the .aa file, 2764 in the .cds file, and 1 in .asmb file 
```{bash}
grep ">" -c Syn_WH101.aa.fasta
grep ">" -c Syn_WH101.cds.fasta
grep ">" -c Syn_WH101.asmb.fasta

```

# What kind of molecule is found in each FASTA file?
## the .aa file contains amino acids/protein seqeunces, the .cds and .asmb files contain DNA/gene seqeunces 
```{bash}
head Syn_WH101.aa.fasta
head Syn_WH101.cds.fasta
head Syn_WH101.asmb.fasta
```


# Why are the Syn_WH101.asmb.fasta and Syn_WH101.cds.fasta files different to each other?
## the .asmb file is the compelte assembled genome of Synechococcus while the .cds file contains smaller coding seqeunces that have not been asssembled 


# Provide at least five different gene/protein names from the FASTA files in question
##using the two sequences with genes and proteins. Less to view, q to exit. 
##examples: 30S ribosomal protein S18 [Cyanobacteria] 30S ribosomal protein S19 translation initiation factor IF-1 BMC domain-containing protein HU family DNA-binding protein protein=DNA topoisomerase 4 subunit A protein=argininosuccinate lyase protein=DNA polymerase III subunit beta protein=RNA methyltransferase protein=phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase subunit PurL

#Find the function for the genes WP_130130185.1 and WP_130130145.1 in the Syn_WH8102.aa.fasta and add them in a R markdown table
## WP_130130185.1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel family protein. WP_130130145.1 is a dephospho-CoA kinase.
```{bash}
grep "WP_130130185.1" Syn_WH101.aa.fasta

```{bash}

#Provide two more protein functions (annotations) and the number of genes associated with them
##There are 552 genes with a â€˜hypothetical proteinâ€™ function in this file. 
```{bash}
grep "ribosomal protein" -c Syn_WH101.aa.fasta.txt
