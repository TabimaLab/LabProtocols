#### DNA Sample Preparations - Dilutions

1. Set up labeled strip tubes in the same order as the primers
  
    - for poop, this should be four sets of eight tubes, make sure you leave blanks for the controls
    
    - this makes transfering in the following steps much easier
    
2. Dilute all samples to 5 ng/ul in 20 ul of PCR pure water

    - follow the dilutions provided on the spreadsheet for any questions
    
#### PCR

1. Before beginning, bleach, ethanol, and UV the PCR hood, UV strip tubes

2. In an ice bucket, make sure you have your HiFi Phusion Taq (blue lid), 5x Buffer (red lid), dNTPs, PCR water, strip tubes of primers (in a 96 well PCR box) and your dilutions, as well as your positive community control and your negative

**For MasterMix:**

In order: 

| Reagents     | Per sample (ul) | Total Mix (ul) |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| H20          |            15.75|        15.75*n |
| Buffer       |                5|            5*n |
| dNTP         |              0.5|          0.5*n |
| Phusion Taq  |              .25|          .25*n |
| Total        |             21.5|           21.5 |

3. Add 21.5 ul of MM to each labeled strip tube

4. Add 2.5 ul of designated primer to each tube

    - you can use a multichannel pipette
    
5. Add 1 ul of DNA to each tube
    
    - again, you can use a multichannel pipette
    
    - (+) and (-) will not be in dilutions strip tube, so do them last
    
6. spin down all strip tubes

#### Thermocycler???

| Temperature |  Time  | Repeat |
|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|
|    98 °C    |  30 s  |        |
|    98 °C    |  45 s  |   x35  |
|    50 °C    |  1 min |   x35  |
|    72 °C    | 1m 30s |   x35  |
|    72 °C    |  10 m  |        |
|     4 °C    |  hold  |        |


#### Gel #1

1. Use a 100bp ladder to check to make sure every sample has a band present around 400bp
  
    - there will be more than just one band but we need the band at 400bp
    
#### Bead Cleanup

1. Do your protocol for bead cleanup

2. Elute in 30 ul of TlowE

#### Gel #2

1. Use a 100bp ladder

2. Verify the presence of the 400bp band

#### Qubit

1. Concentrations will be between 2-10 ng/ul, usually

2. Make sure to Qubit the controls as well

#### When samples don't work

1. do 'em again :(
