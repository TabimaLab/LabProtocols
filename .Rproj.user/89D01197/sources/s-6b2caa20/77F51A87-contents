Copied the Nanopore data into my own files using 

```
/course_data/BIOL209/Cyano_2023/nanopore$ cp -R S06 /Tabima_lab/homes/mdelcogliano/Genome/nanopore/
```
Then we looked at the html file

#### How many reads were generated by your Nanopore run?

9.9k

#### How many bases passed the quality filters?

6.27Mb

#### Based on the Read Length Histogram Basecalled Bases figure, what was your N50?

1.18kb

length of the read that encompasses the highest 50% of the data half of the reads are shorter than N50 and half are longer than N50

#### Based on your Read Length Histogram Basecalled Bases, what was the length of the longest read you sequenced?

27.88kb was the longest read

#### Based on the Mux Scan Grouped figure, what was the maximum number of Active pores (green bars) in your run? What time?

75 at two minutes into the run

#### Based on the QScore figure, do you see a decrease in quality over time?

Yes, overtime the quality decreased below the min quality score, dipped significantly below the line and then recovered. This continued to decrease overtime.
